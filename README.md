This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages

Sometimes you want to have a subdirectory on the `master` branch be the root directory of a repository’s `gh-pages` branch. This is useful for things like sites developed with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), or if you have a Jekyll site contained in the `master` branch alongside the rest of your code.

For the sake of this example, let’s pretend the subfolder containing your site is named `build`.

### Step 1

Remove the `build` directory from the project’s `.gitignore` file (it’s ignored by default by Yeoman).

### Step 2

Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

```sh
git add dist && git commit -m "Initial build subtree commit"
```

### Step 3

Use subtree push to send it to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

```sh
git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages
```

Boom. If your folder isn’t called `build`, then you’ll need to change that in each of the commands above.

If you do this on a regular basis, you could also [create a script](https://github.com/cobyism/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-gh-deploy) containing the following somewhere in your path:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "$1" ]
then
  echo "Which folder do you want to deploy to GitHub Pages?"
  exit 1
fi
git subtree push --prefix $1 origin gh-pages
```

Which lets you type commands like:

```sh
git gh-deploy path/to/your/site
```
